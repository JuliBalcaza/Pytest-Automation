Pytest Automation Project

##📄 Overview
This is a sample project for automating web testing using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern and the Pytest framework. It includes a basic structure to facilitate automated testing of a web application with test cases focused on login functionalities.

##🛠️ Project Structure
POM/: Implements the Page Object Model (POM) pattern.

base_page.py: Contains common methods used by all pages.
login_page.py: Contains methods specific to login functionalities.
helpers/: Contains utility files.

credentials.py: Stores dummy credentials for testing purposes.
tests/: Contains the test cases.

test_login.py: Test cases for login functionality using the login page object.

##🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
Install dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Running the Tests
To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

`pytest`

##Test Report
Pytest generates a detailed report of the test run, including any errors or failures. You can use the following command to view a more detailed HTML report:

`pytest --html=report.html`

##🔑 Key Concepts
Page Object Model (POM): This design pattern improves test maintainability by separating the logic of interactions from the test scripts themselves.
Pytest: A popular testing framework in Python, used for writing simple as well as scalable test cases.

##📝 Notes
The credentials.py file contains placeholder data for testing purposes. Replace these with actual test data when necessary.
Modify the page objects and test cases as needed to suit the application under test.
